## IMPORTANT NOTE ON COPYWRIGHT
This project is 100% for the purpose of practice. It is a modified clone of the Starbucks website and may contain photos or copy that are under copywright by Starbucks and therefore SHOULD NOT be cloned or forked for further usage. I do not claim to own any of these design assets. All code however, is my original written code.
